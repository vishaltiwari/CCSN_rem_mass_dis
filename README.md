# Core Collapse Supernova remnant mass Distribution

## About:
Star having mass more that 11 Solar Masses undergo core-collapse supernova explosion, and leaves behind a compact objects, either a neutron star or a black hole, which would depend on the initial mass function and the initial metallicity of the progenitor star.
In this project I have explored the 
Exploration of Mass Distribution function of Black holes and Neutron Stars using Mesa

- Using the 25M_pre_ms_to_core_collapse MESA model to explore the following parameter space 
 -- Initial Mass: [11-40]M_sun
 -- Initial Z : [0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1,1.2,1.5,2]
